# Breaking-Linear-Congruential-Generators

A simple R program to break any linear congruential generators with 5 or more consecutive samples.

Contains a c++ implementation of computing modulo inverses which is used to compute the multiplier.

See the [Demo Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/GAmuzak/Breaking-Linear-Congruential-Generators/blob/main/demo.ipynb) on how to use the function.

See the [LCG Breaker R Script](https://github.com/GAmuzak/Breaking-Linear-Congruential-Generators/blob/main/lcg_breaker.R) for the steps to crack the parameters of a linear congruential generator.
